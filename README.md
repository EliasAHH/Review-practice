# React Review Prep

This is study guide I created to help you best prepare for your upcoming review. Along with this review is a React app attached in which you can practice using functions like sort and filter and other things you may feel weak on. 

## Key Concepts

The React rubric is designed to confirm understanding of the following key concepts:

### Essential

- Use `state` to handle the saving, and updating of components
- Create functions that should be actionable by a user event (onClick, onChange)
- Explain the flow of data from React, through Redux and back to React (Store, Reducer, React)
- Write standard Javascript code under the pressure of an in person interview (You got this!! Practice coding infront of people)
- Understand how to pass data/functions through to components using props

## Project Requirements 
 ### Please make sure you have all these completed before your interview.
- The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
- Use the `create*react*app` generator to start your project.
- Your app should have one HTML page to render your React-Redux application
- There should be 2 container components
- There should be 5 stateless components
- There should be 3 routes
- The Application must make use of `react*router` and proper RESTful routing
- Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change
- Make use of async actions to send data to and receive data from a server
- Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using `fetch()` within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
- Your client\*side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
- Your application should have some minimal styling

###  Part 1
- You are going to get treated like this is a real interview, meaning every part of your code can be questioned at any point during the interview. Please make sure to review your code before your interview and feel confident explaining EVERYTHING. 

- Come prepared, drink lots of water, and always remember to BREATH! You've done this hundred's of times at this point , this time is no different. You got this! Remember to have fun with it as well.

###  Part 2 

- A walkthrough of your app 

- Explain full flow of when a user clicks on an event or something and how data flows from react - redux - action creators - reducers - mapStateToProps. Explain the whole flow! 

- Understand the order react renders and mounts 

- Understand Thunk. How's it's used, why it's used. ( Remember Thunk is a Middleware)

### Things to study for that have to do with part 2

- What's the difference between State and Props?
- WHat's the difference between a functional and class based component? (Why use one over the other at times)
- What's the importance of setState? Why can't we mutate state directly like this this.state = "Hello"
- Difference between Arrow functions and regular function declaration? 
- What is a Virtual DOM and how does it differ from a regular DOM? 


### Things not as important to know but still pretty good to understand|
   - Lifecycle methods and what they do for us 
   - React Hooks
   - I might add more to the list a bit later. 

### Part 3 - Live coding 

I can't help you with this as this showcases your own knowledge and how you can code under pressure but I have attached a react app that you can use as your playground. You can test different JavaScript functionalities here. There is no Redux attached on this so this will give you practice on changing functional components into class components to accomodate you as needed. 


### Final Thoughts 

I know this isn't much but I feel this will help you to be as prepared as you're going to be for this review. Every cohort lead is different on how they run their individual assessments but, these are the important topics to understand in React. If you're able to understand these and properly explain it you're going to do AMAZING! 

Best of luck and I hope you're able to achieve your goal at the end of the day!
